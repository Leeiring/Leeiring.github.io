    <p>Paradigm shifts: when a general perception/mental model is changed and seen differently
      <br> I had a few different ideas of paradigm shifts I wanted to research. 
      I decided to look into how people have changed their views on relationships, specifically romantic relationships and heteronormativity; and how this also affects other relationships such as platonic and familial.

    <p>Paradigm shifts: when a general perception/mental model is changed and seen differently
      <br> I had a few different ideas of paradigm shifts I wanted to research. 
      I decided to look into how people have changed their views on relationships, specifically romantic relationships and heteronormativity; and how this also affects other relationships such as platonic and familial. 
      <br> From this I identified drivers (long term dynamics that shape or compel trends) and (signals something you encounter that provides insight or evidence that can show change)

    <h3>Exhibition space research</h3> 
    <p>
      <br>Zach Blas - CULTUS
      <br>CULTUS is an immersive room that presents four AI gods within the tech industry:
      <li>Expositio - AI god of desire and exposure </li>
      <li>Iudicium - AI god of automation and judgement </li>
      <li>Lacrimae - AI god of tears and extraction  </li>
      <li>Eternus - AI god of immortal life </li>
      
      <br>180 strand studio UVA Synchronicity - Our Time
      <li>The installation is titled ‘Our Time’ which is stated to be a spatial instrument that reveals the elastic, enigmatic nature of time. As a singular viewer, other viewers can be seen as part of the installation: watching new people pass by, how they react to the room, the lights outlining different figures as time is a share experience.</li>

      <br>180 strand studio UVA Synchronicity - Polyphony
      <li> 
        The space is made to have viewers contemplate the role of sound in shaping our world. A circular array of LED sticks that display light inside and outside its structure. </li>

      <img src="immersive_w/immersive3.png" width="100%"  data-hover="One of the most interesting but simple things that makes this immersive is the layout of the objects along with the viewers perspective/positioning. With the light design on the ground with the black surface differing to the grey surface in the room, it makes viewers not walk within the structure but observe around it. As a face appears on the sphere, viewers would position themselves in front of the face which also makes them stand in front of a pyramid. Upon closer inspection, the contents within the pyramid is something the god wants from the human body, they mention the substance within their speech e.g Lacrimae wants tears and urges people to feel emotions to their full extent until they cry. It can be seen that the viewers are in a position to worship the gods, having the pyramids in between the gods and views makes the items within deemed as offerings to the gods. 
      Signs of worship are also seen within the into songs for the gods. The songs are sung as hymns, each unique to its god e.g Iudiciums’ hymn has a more traditional religious structure of a hymn while Expositios’ is more of a personal sexual plea. The chained boards with the lyrics on the song try to encourage the viewers to follow along as the music plays and the screens set the colours and tone for the AI Gods arrival.

      The installation is titled ‘Our Time’ which is stated to be a spatial instrument that reveals the elastic, enigmatic nature of time. As a singular viewer, other viewers can be seen as part of the installation: watching new people pass by, how they react to the room, the lights outlining different figures as time is a share experience. Music itself cannot be heard without the presence of time, the visuals of the swinging pendulums accompanied by ticking sounds create the thought of the room being a metronome. Metronomes are used for timing within music. The ticking sounds don’t match with a particular pendulum, all are falling in and out of sync with each other, evens their movement is unhindered by the laws of gravity. Maybe the presence of three pendulums refers to times past, present and future. I liked how this room is positioned to be the second and last installation you experience serving as a reminder and reflection of the time views have spend within the exhibition. these elements illustrates times enigmatic nature, the room is everchanging whether its the audience, lights or music.">
      <img src="immersive_w/immersiv31-2.png" width="100%"  data-hover="The order of the recordings and light display follow a journey, creating and slowly building a world around the viewer. The use of light and sound working in sync with each other instigates them to place the scenery: identify what the water source is, have an idea of where certain animals are and what kind of habitats surrounds them without the need for visual imagery. It creates a shared experience with other viewers as they are in the same room listening, experiencing the same senses but interpretations will be different. 
      The use of only using lights and audio to portray a natural environment alludes to these types of environments and music being lost to industrialisation and the ongoing extinction of species. The natural experience of these organic habitats are slowly dying out, Polyphony is an interpretation of a way to preserve and experience these spaces.">

    <h3>Ideation</h3> 
    <p>I wanted to use the virtual world to create my paradigm shift in action.
      Two perspectives of a theatrical/cinematic experience and also an immersive/exploration experience. This lets the users optionally explore the area to gain more insight of the narrative. </p>

      <img src="immersive_w/immersive4.png" width="100%"  data-hover="These are my concept sketches / story boards. I want the scenarios in my world to be simple scenes you can see everyday because I want my audience to learn that relationships outside of the heteronormative definition exist and are normal. 

      To keep the story simple, I'll have these scenes framed around a protagonist growing up. Misinterpreting outside bonds can happen at any point in someone life. The main phases I want to illustrate are the protagonist as a child, teenager and adult. ">
      <img src="immersive_w/immersive4-1.png" width="100%"  data-hover="Goodbye Eri is a one shot manga of a film aspiring boy called Yuta fulfilling a request from his mother to record her final moments. After her death, he meets a mysterious girl: Eri. They bond over their love for movies and create one of their own, however Eri keeps a secret that when revealed, changes the narrative for Yuta and the reader.
      The author Tatsuki Fujimoto makes use of his medium, manga panels, and plays with the aspect ratio throughout the story. There’s panels presented as phone camera recordings and some that break out of the camera dimensions. This combination creates an unreliable narrator, we aren’t sure what is reality and what is fiction. Overall, the seemingly one storyline can be interpreted in three ways: everything is fiction, everything is non fiction or the mix of both. There is also a fourth story told when only looking at the blurred frames.
      This inspired me to also experiment with aspect ratio within perspectives, limiting what the viewer can see or having them view from a camera perspective.">

      <h3>Development</h3> 
      <p>I first place cameras in Unreal Engine to position the frame I want to place an illustration on. I then import these camera images into procreate to draw over and then import the illustration layers into Unreal Engine as a PNG plane. This gives the effect of the image only being shown on one side of the plane making the image placement intentional for the user to move and explore more within the world.
        <br>I drew the line art and colour layers separately to create a 2D layer effect once the images are placed into Unreal Engine.
        I also drew some items on separate layers within a single illustration frame to give more depth- here the food items are a separate illustration as the man.
