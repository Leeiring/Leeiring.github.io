    <h3>User research pt 2</h3> 
    <p>Here are some insights from a survey I conducted that was about Muji brand, products and customer experience. This was to see if there are any positive insights I can elevate in my redesign but also to tackle what Muji lacks. This survey was looking into the customers retail experience.
      <br> Results show that most MUJI shoppers like the instore experience and being able to physically hold and see products. The only times customers use online shopping is when items are too difficult to transport home manually such as purchasing a large amount of items or buying large items such as furniture.

    <h3>Store AR installation</h3> 
    <p>For Muji window and indoor product displays, adding an AR interaction where people can view displays with animated assets. These animations can be changed seasonally, relate to current events involving Muji or connect to the brands Japanese roots; creating a feeling of fantasy within the instore experience.  
      This animation was based on cherry blossom season in Japan which happens around late March to Early April. Displaying a QR code on store window displays for passer-bys to access and use can encourage them to go inside the store.
    <br> 
      <br> Keone could be interested in interacting with this touchpoint as a regular passer-by of a MUJI store. She can also enjoy an instore experience without purchasing anything by interacting with AR animations inside the store. This could also present her unique insights on Japanese related culture, backgrounds of displayed products or collaborators which can connect her to MUJI.

      <img src="muji_redes/muji8-1.png" width="100%"  data-hover="Delight Exhibition had an optional part where participants can find hidden Hangul slates in the different exhibition rooms. These Hangul were scannable using the Delight app, once scan it showed 3D animations of different Korean foods ranging from traditional to street food. On the app there's a separate section which displays the out of the 12 Hangul which ones you cave collected or not.  
      This optional element of the exhibition was a great way to have viewers investigate the exhibition room with more detail, encouraging them to stay longer and find all 12 Hangul (which was rewarded with a free gift shop item)  
      The app also serves as a digital souvenir, holding information about the exhibitions and the collectable Hangul foods.
      
      Dev notes
      This touchpoint is made with the flexibility to display different kinds of AR animations, the cherry blossom animation is a good example that can bring Japanese atmosphere in places outside Japan. Other examples may include seasonal themes, Japanese related themes, collaborations or MUJI event related periods (like MUJI week).  
      I wanted to put emphasis on MUJI as a brand and statement instead of MUJI being defined by their products, people are aware of its nature and sleek look but not so much on its core backgrounds which are one of the fundamentals that build their products.">

    <h3>Interactive digital posters for local events</h3> 
    <p>An interactive digital web poster to advertise Muji events that are exclusive to London. These events have high emphasis on building community and giving a stage to small businesses to shine. 
      I'll be using the latest event to display this touchpoint - Muji Community Market conducted at Angel Islington Central Piazza.
    <br>Itou would be interested in community related events. As these businesses are hosted by MUJI, they would have similar brand perspectives and philosophies.
    Keone although not heavily interested or involved in MUJI products can still connect through the brand with events hosted my MUJI. Within these events she can interact with the brand through their services or spending a lot of money on products that she deems expensive
    Although not physically near the event, Ley can interact and learn about these businesses though this digital poster.   </p>

      Instead of an app format I used a website, this makes it more accessible for ios and android users
      Dev notes
      I avoided building a touchpoint that was app related as MUJI customers don't have any major issues on shopping instore or online. Also I felt like having an app doesn't align with MUJIs perspective on simplistic service satisfaction. This specific touchpoint is designed for non MUJI customers in mind.
I used p5js as its easy to code on a laptop and test access through a link on mobile
The basic set up of the website is a 360 camera view of the area the event takes place, in which the perspective controlled by tilting the mobile device. Layered over this is the MUJI market title, location and businesses featured.
The ideal set up would have buttons that are anchored on the different stalls in the image, selecting a button will show a summarised description of what the store sells and a link to the corresponding business website">

      Create an interactable asset that uses mobile orientation/gyroscope This version of code only works for ios 13 and above users as I prototyped it on my own device
Configure the interaction for a 360 camera image view As I was working in p5js, it has a limit of image size, so I simplified my desired image by making an abstracted drawing over it and using that as the imported image

    <h3>Website</h3> 
    <p> An added section to the MUJI website where there's an option to view the online store as an isometric 3D building environment, simulating a unique online experience for people who like the atmosphere of instore shopping but don't have easy access to a MUJI store.

      Another section of the website is a page that displays different customised rooms which hold MUJI products in settings with different interiors and aesthetics. The MUJI products are also customised through different colours, materials and varnishes  showing that a simple change while still upholding the original functionality of design can be effective and desired for audiences who don't align with the general light minimalistic style MUJI is associated with.
    <br> Ley who has missed the physical experiences of stores she doesn't have close access to can benefit from using the 3D isometric structure of the MUJI website. The visuals present the website in a more physical like navigation; along with the option to view products in moveable 3D models contributes to the senses someone would use purchasing something in a physical store. 
    Keone can use the customisation feature to look at how MUJI products can be stylised to her liking, giving people a special tailored version of a product. She can also see how MUJI products can synchronise to multiple style when given specific qualities.

      <img src="muji_redes/muji10-1.png" width="100%"  data-hover="I experienced a large MUJI store in Shibuya Japan, upon entering the building there was a large illustrated map in an isometric structure displaying and abstracted map of the building, indicating what category of products are on which floor. This was the main reference I used for the layout and imagery.
      I originally had filter selections on the custom rooms where people can filter through room options, while roleplay testing the website screens I overestimated how much custom rooms are to be displayed on a page to the point where there wasn’t a need for a filter as it was deemed as an extra step during the roleplay. 
I also added a small notification on the 3D product viewing interaction, signalling the user that they can interact with the 3D model by dragging the image to rotate it and zooming in and out. ">
